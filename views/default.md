What is TinyDocs?
-----------------

TinyDocs is an open source project that you install on your server to provide curated documentation in an organized format to your users.

TinyDocs has wiki-like features that allow you to:

* Add new pages
* Edit existing pages while maintaining a history of changes.
* Reorganize content within the table of contents.
* Automate creation of a search index and glossary of all your pages.
* Solicit public comments from visitors on documentation pages to improve their usefulness.
